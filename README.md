# P3-Spam-Mail-Classification-by-NLP-and-ML

<p>My project is about differentiate between the spam mail and non spam mail. Just put your mail and it will shown that if the mail is a spam or not </p>

<h2> To do that we make a python file and a python notebook. You can easily run the notebook. But to run the python file you have to write "streamlit run filename.py" in the terminal. </h2>

# Thank you
